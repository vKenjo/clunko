;; SECURITY NOTE: Clarity checker warning on line 442 is a FALSE POSITIVE
;; ====================================================================
;; Warning: "use of potentially unchecked data" for entry-id parameter
;; 
;; WHY THIS IS SAFE:
;; 1. We verify the entry exists via map-get? lookup (line 404)
;; 2. The match expression ensures we only proceed if entry exists
;; 3. If entry doesn't exist, function returns err-invalid-numbers
;; 4. The entry-id is validated implicitly by successful map lookup
;; 
;; WHY THE WARNING PERSISTS:
;; This is a known limitation of Clarity's static analyzer. It cannot infer that:
;; - Successful map-get? with specific keys validates those keys
;; - Using the same keys in subsequent map operations is safe
;; - The match pattern proves the keys are valid
;; 
;; VERIFICATION:
;; - All unit tests pass
;; - Entry existence is checked before any state changes
;; - No path to use invalid entry-id exists in this function
;; 
;; This warning can be safely ignored.
